       **Note :**
              Please note that the partial updates are supported via PUT APIs. However, Note that If "null" value is passed for any element, in the PUT request body, it will be ignored. An empty string value should be sent (instead of "null" value) for the elements that need to be updated with NULL values.

        for (e.g., a client, enrollments, etc.).  It's designed to  find the one
        result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for).
        Currently hmislynk supporting search on 'clients' entity only. Just like
        searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search
        results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs.
